# The Exam Score Prediction App

## Mission Statement
My mission is to champion education as a tool to dismantle inequality, providing every individual with equal opportunities to succeed. Machine Learning and Data Science
can play a crucial role in this in multiple ways such as fighting algorithmic bias in education systems, data-driven policy design, and personalized learning among many others.

## Project Description
This project uses a linear regression model to predict student exam scores. It shows different features such as parental involvement, quality of teachers, access to the internet, 
and hours of sleep come together to affect the result a student can achieve on a test. This further highlights the need for equity in education.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project has been sourced for free on Kaggle. You can find the data by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors).

## A Comprehensive Guide on running the app
Before running the app, make sure you have:
- Flutter SDK
- Mobile Emulator
- VS Code

1. Clone the repository into VS Code:
` git clone https://github.com/JesseKiguta/lr-summative.git `

2. Navigate to the app's directory:
` cd exam_score_prediction_app `

3. Run the app:
` flutter run `

4. Select the emulator of your choice and interact with the app once it loads.

Note: All fields must be filled out for the model to make a prediction. Also, fields such as `Teacher Quality (Low)` and `Internet Access (Yes)` must only take either 0 or 1 
for the model to work.
